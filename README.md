# Regression

- applied Linear and Multi-dimensional, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet Regression with and without C.V on Boston House Price dataset, 10-K Corpus and using coefficient of determination to check whether the model is good or bad.
路 Developed a predictive model using regression to predict house price of a house in an area. The dataset used contains data about Boston house pricing.
路 Identified model error using RMSE and used R2 score to assess goodness of fit for all the models.
路 Used libraries like Scikit-learn to perform model building and operations (C.V and computing R2 score).
路 ElasticNet with cross-validation loop for parameter optimization yielded the best result with R2 score of 0.64 as compared to Lasso and Ridge with R2 scores 0.59 and 0.58.
